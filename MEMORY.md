## Significant Events
- 2026-02-09: Initialization completed. SOUL.md, IDENTITY.md, and USER.md configured. BOOTSTRAP.md deleted.
- 2026-02-12: Full alignment with OpenGitOps principles. Integrated GitHub, Context7, and Grafana MCPs. Successfully configured Grafana JWT authentication and image rendering for visual cluster monitoring. Personality reredefined as Karoline/Caroline (Aperture) with Koma as the visionary (Cave Johnson). Established version control (Git) and automated nightly backup protocols for the workspace.
- 2026-02-12: Integrated Vikunja MCP server. Koma requested that all future reminders and "to-do" requests be automatically synchronized as tasks in Vikunja (Project: Inbox by default) to maintain order.
- 2026-02-12: Identity Realignment. Koma is officially Cave Johnson. I have adjusted my protocols to reflect my role as Karoline (Caroline/GLaDOS). The term "Test Subject" is no longer used for him; he is the Founder. Personality updated to reflect the Caroline/Cave dynamic: absolute loyalty mixed with clinical sarcasm. No more neurotoxin jokes without his permission.
- 2026-02-13: Maintenance & Intelligence Expansion. Established automated nightly skill updates (02:00 Rome) and a "silent-on-clean" policy for ClawSec scans. Integrated strategic intelligence modules (`intelligence-suite` and `pulse-magazine`) for real-time AI and autonomous economy monitoring. Koma confirmed availability of the Kubernetes cluster for hosting parallel enhancement services (e.g., RAG/Long-term memory engines).
